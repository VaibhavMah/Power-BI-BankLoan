The Details page presents a structured table view of individual loan applications with fields like purpose, home ownership, grade, issue date, funded amount, installment, interest rate, and DTI. It allows for in-depth exploration of each record and supports filtering by purpose, grade, and state for better drill-down analysis. <br>
